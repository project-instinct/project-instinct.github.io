# Project Instinct

This is the repository that contains source code for the [Project Instinct website](https://project-instinct.github.io).

Project Instinct explores instinct-level intelligences for whole-body control in robotics through deep learning approaches. Our research focuses on developing advanced control systems that enable robots to perform complex, dynamic tasks like parkour and agile locomotion.

## Research Areas

- **Whole-body Control**: Coordinated control of entire robotic systems for dynamic tasks
- **Deep Learning for Robotics**: Neural network approaches for motor control and perception
- **Parkour and Agile Locomotion**: High-performance, acrobatic robot movement capabilities
- **Real-time Inference**: Onboard deployment of learned policies on robotic platforms
